# UAB GitLab Registration Instructions

Our GitLab instance may be found at <https://gitlab.rc.uab.edu>.

## UAB Affiliated Users

If you are a UAB affiliated user and have a BlazerId, you may create an account by logging in at the [UAB GitLab](<https://gitlab.rc.uab.edu>) site using the `ldap` tab. Please use your BlazerID and BlazerID password (single sign-on (SSO) credentials). For example, blaze@uab.edu would sign in with Username `blaze` and their BlazerID password.

!!! note "UABMC Credentials Will Not Work"
    
    You must use your BlazerID and BlazerID password. UABMC credentials are a completely separate password database not accessible by central UAB services. Therefore, UABMC credentials will not work for RC GitLab or any other Research Computing services.
