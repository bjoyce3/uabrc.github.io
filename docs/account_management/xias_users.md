# Managing UAB XIAS Researchers

UAB XIAS Researcher management allow UAB faculty and staff to grant external collaborators access to specific resources on the internal UAB network. All XIAS researchers must be connected with at least one site, so you'll need to create one at the [UAB XIAS Researcher Management Webpage](https://idm.uab.edu/cgi-cas/xrmi/sites). All XIAS Researchers must also have an expiration date.

## Adding Researchers

wish to add researchers to, as well as expiration dates for each researcher.

1. To start go to the [UAB XIAS Researcher Management Webpage](https://idm.uab.edu/cgi-cas/xrmi/sites).

## Discovering and Managing Researchers

There are two ways to discover XIAS researchers you are currently sponsoring.
The first is to search by email address. The second is to list all researchers
associated with a site.

### Discovering Researchers

1. To locate researchers by e-mail address: type their email into the "Locate specific researcher(s) by e-mail address" text field on the "Manage Researchers" page.

    ![!UAB XIAS Researcher Management Webpage. An email search has been performed using the text field and a table listing names and emails is present at the top of the page.](./images/xias_researchers_list_000.png)

2. To manage researchers by site: select the site from the drop-down box and click the "List" button. The page will reload with a table containing name, email, and start and end dates. The end date is when the XIAS researcher registration expires. To change the end date for researcher(s), click the "Sel" checkbox next to their names, enter a date in the "Change end date for selected researchers to" text field, and click "Update".
